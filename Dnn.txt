Title: Understanding the Data Network Name (DNN) in 5G SystemsBody:In 3GPP-defined 5G architecture, the Data Network Name (DNN) identifies an external data network (DN) that a UE (User Equipment) wants to connect to through the mobile network. It plays a role similar to the Access Point Name (APN) in 4G.A DNN is typically configured in the Session Management Function (SMF) and is part of the PDU Session Establishment Request sent by the UE. Each DNN maps to a specific IP network or service, such as:• Internet (public web access)• IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)• Enterprise or private networksKey attributes of DNNs:• Defined per Subscription Profile in the Unified Data Management (UDM).• Configured per Slice (S-NSSAI), enabling slice-specific service exposure.• Can support multiple PDU session types (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet, etc.).Example:• DNN = internet• DNN = ims• DNN = corp-vpnDNN in Network Functions:• The AMF forwards the DNN in the NAS message to the SMF.• The SMF selects the appropriate User Plane Function (UPF) based on the DNN and S-NSSAI.• The UPF anchors the data session to the specified external data network.Use Cases:• Multi-DNN support: A UE can establish multiple PDU sessions to different DNNs simultaneously.• Private 5G: Enterprises use custom DNNs (e.g., factory.local) to isolate internal traffic.• Roaming scenarios: DNN selection is subject to home or visited network policies.
